## General Information

- ### Problem Statement
### US-based housing company named "Surprise Housing" has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price

The company wants to know:

Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house

How well those variables describe the price of a house.

Also, determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.

- ### Business Goal:
You are required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables.

This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. 

They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns.

Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.


## Conclusions
### linear regression model was overfitting data although train score was more, test score is very low suggesting model overfitting, Ridge and Lasso regression was used to regularize model to have good fit
### Top features effecting Sale Price as per our final model(LASSO) are:
#### ->Roof material
#### ->Above grade (ground) living area square feet
#### ->Adjacent positive offset area(Ex adjacent to park)
#### ->Overall Quality
#### ->Kitchen Quality
#### ->Basement features and quality
#### ->Garage cars
#### ->Neighbourhood
